Professional Self-Assessment

Going through the Computer Science program and putting together this portfolio really helped me see how far I’ve come. Every course and project added something new, and looking back I can see how it all fits together. This portfolio isn’t just a set of assignments—it shows the skills I’ve built, the problems I’ve solved, and how I’ve grown into someone ready to work in the field.

Strengths and Growth

One of the biggest things I’ve gained is flexibility. I’ve worked with different languages—C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL—and learned to pick the right tool for the job. I also got a lot better at writing secure and reliable code, whether that meant catching errors early, validating input, or working with encryption.

I’ve also learned a lot about teamwork. In software engineering classes, working on group projects showed me how important clear communication is. I had to share ideas, accept feedback, and keep everyone on the same page. Those experiences will help me a lot when I’m part of a professional team.

Another skill I’ve built is being able to explain technical stuff to people who aren’t technical. Through design docs and security presentations, I practiced breaking down complex ideas into something easy to follow. That’s a skill I’ll need anytime I talk with clients, managers, or end users.

Technical Focus

Data Structures and Algorithms: I practiced recursion, sorting, searching, and comparing performance between things like std::map and std::unordered_map.

Software Engineering and Databases: I built and improved applications with database connections, CRUD operations, and user validation.

Security: My work on encryption and secure coding taught me how to spot and prevent issues like buffer overflows or weak cryptography.

Challenges and Lessons

There were plenty of challenges—debugging stubborn logic, dealing with setup errors, and learning new tools fast. But those challenges taught me persistence and patience. I also learned that mistakes are just part of the process, and working through them made me stronger.

Portfolio Overview

The projects in this portfolio highlight different areas of what I can do. The file encryption project shows secure coding and cryptography. The grocery tracker shows my use of data structures and algorithms. The course planner highlights database integration and benchmarking. Together, they cover a wide range of skills and show that I can adapt to different challenges in computer science.
